# Wagg.ly - Cloud Full Stack Implementation

## Project Description
Wagg.ly is a cloud-based application that allows users to register pets and dog walkers. It provides a platform to manage pet and dog walker information.
The application is built using a full-stack architecture with a front-end web application and a RESTful API backend, connected to an Azure SQL database.

## Dependencies
- [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet): Framework for building the web application and RESTful API.
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/): Programming language used for back-end development.
- [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/): ORM for interacting with the Azure SQL Database.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/): Integrated development environment (IDE) used for building and deploying the application.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): Source code repository platform.

## Azure Services
- **Azure App Service**: Hosts the ASP.NET application, providing a scalable and reliable platform for the web application and API.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Stores the pet and dog walker information.
